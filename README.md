# VirtualAlphaDx

Virtual Robot for UBTech Alpha 1P (DirectX version)

This project was developed with Helix Toolkit 1.1.0.
Since Helix Toolkit has been changed much in v2.X, which is not compatible with this project, please install Helix Toolkit v1.1.0 in NuGet Package Manager.

This is only a backup of VirtualAlphaDx, which can only simulate RobotControl v1.0, some feature may not work if connecting with MyAlphaRobotV2.  It will be rewriten with  Helix Toolkit 2.X, and work with RobotControl & MyAlphaRobot in V3 later.
